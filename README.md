## Description
This repository contains the source code for my personal website live at https://slz37.github.io/

This is used as learning experience for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. while also creating a useful site for connecting all of my material and exploring my creative side. The current state is very bare bones and has a lot of work to be done.

Note: In order to run a local version, it's necessary to run a local server. The simplest way to do this with Python 3 is:
```
Open command prompt and cd to the working directory, e.g. cd .../slz37.github.io/
Run python3 -m http.server
Open http://localhost:8000/ in your preferred browser.
```

## Primary to-do list:

* Auto resize div for pdf files.
* Write more about my Limit Calculator/convert that to a blog describing all of my projects in detail and other topics.
* Add my senior thesis.
* Make overall design more appealing.
