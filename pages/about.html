			About Me
		</div>
		<div id="subcontent">
			<p>Hello, my name is Salvatore Zerbo. I graduated from Drexel University with a B.S. in Physics and minors in Astrophysics and Mathematics in June 2019. My primary interests within physics are Cosmology and Astroparticle physics. I wrote an undergraduate thesis on developing a Bi-Be low energy neutron source, and my thesis and all the related files can be viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/slz37/Undergraduate-Thesis">Github</a>. During my senior year, I picked up an enthusiastic interest in programming alongside physics. I very quickly enlisted in as many CS courses as I could in addition to working on projects on my own. My github and this webpage are available as a result.

			I have many hobbies outside of my academic interests. I am a competitive runner, you can see my training located on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/7142146">Strava</a>. I frequently compete in all types of races, including road races, cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track. My favorite race distance is 5km; however, I've raced everything from 800m up to 10 miles. I'm not a particularly fast runner; however, these are my PR's if you're interested:
			<table class="subTable" style="width:20%">
			  <tr>
				<td>800m</td>
				<td>2:15</td> 
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>1600m/Mile</td>
				<td>4:56</td> 
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>3200m/2 Mile</td>
				<td>10:50</td> 
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>5km</td>
				<td>~16:45</td> 
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>8km</td>
				<td>~29:30</td> 
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>10 Mile</td>
				<td>1:00:02</td> 
			  </tr>

			I'm also an avid music listener and amateur guitarist. I've played the guitar since elementary school, although I am only interested in being a bedroom guitarist. I enjoy artists from nearly every genre, although I enjoy progressive rock/metal the most. A few of my favorite bands/artists are:

			  <tr>
				<td>Leprous</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Lunatic Soul</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Agent Fresco</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Pink Floyd</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Keiichi Okabe</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
			The rest of my time is spent watching movies, anime, playing video games, watching interesting Youtube videos, and reading interesting articles. I always enjoy learning new things from Philosophy to Music Theory, and I hope I never stop learning. Thank you for dropping by!
